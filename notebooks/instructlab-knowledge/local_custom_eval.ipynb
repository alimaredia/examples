    "# Custom evaluations of the fine tuned model locally\n",
    "\n",
    "After fine tuning and deploying your model for testing, you can compare it to the accuracy and faithfulness of responses from other models in RAG based systems.  If you'd like to compare your model to others and see how it performs, this notebook will help you do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: If you'd like to do a standard evaluation using the llm-eval-app service, use the `eval_rh_api.ipynb` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare for the evaluation, you will need to have the following:\n",
    "1. A set of models deployed and accessible via an API.\n",
    "2. A config.yaml file with the model information.\n",
    "3. A set of reference questions and answers in a common format (csv, jsonl, or qna.yaml).\n",
    "4. A set of context data in PDF format.  These are generally the documents that the model was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Sanity check the models to ensure your configuration is working correctly.\n",
    "2. Generate reference questions and answers from the `reference_answers` directory.\n",
    "3. Generate sample context data using a Milvus Lite Vector DB and the PDFs in the `data_preparation/document_collection` directory.\n",
    "4. Get responses from each of the available models.\n",
    "5. Grade responses using InstructLab.\n",
    "6. Grade responses using OpenAI ChatGPT-4o as a Judge Model.\n",
    "7. Save the results and create a resulting score report in Excel, Markdown, and HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the notebook, you will have json file with the evaluation and a summary of the evaluation results in an Excel, Markdown, and HTML.\n",
    "\n",
