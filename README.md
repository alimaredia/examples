# Examples  

The `examples` repo is a place where the maintainers of the project can collect notebooks for the benefit of the community.

This repository contains [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and other examples that illustrate parts of or an entire model customization pipeline.

## Repository Structure

Notebooks either live in the `combined-stages` or `use-cases` directories.

```bash

```

### Notebooks for Combined InstructLab stages

Notebooks in the `combined-stages` directory go through parts of or an entire model customization workflow that users might want to reference or use.
Some examples of combined stages are a notebook that runs through training then evaluation or a notebook that goes from document pre-processing to synthetic data generation.

### Notebooks for End-to-End (e2e) use cases

Notebooks in the `use-cases` directory reflect real world use cases from start to finish.
